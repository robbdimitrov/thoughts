### Infrastructure StatefulSets

| Service                                  | CPU req | Mem req | Mem limit | PVC size |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| database (postgres:18.4-alpine)          | 500m    | 512Mi   | 512Mi     | 5 Gi     |
| cache (dragonflydb)                      | 100m    | 64Mi    | 256Mi     | 1 Gi     |
| storage (chrislusf/seaweedfs)            | 100m    | 64Mi    | 256Mi     | 5 Gi     |
| search (getmeili/meilisearch:v1.15)      | 100m    | 256Mi   | 1 Gi      | 1 Gi     |
| broker (redpandadata/redpanda)           | 100m    | 256Mi   | 512Mi     | 2 Gi     |

Redpanda Connect runs as a Deployment and mounts broker pipeline configuration
from a ConfigMap. All PVCs: ReadWriteOnce. All StatefulSets: 1 replica. All
`emptyDir` volumes set `sizeLimit`.
PostgreSQL serves in-cluster connections without TLS (`sslmode=disable` in the
shared `database-url` Secret value) — connections stay within the cluster's
internal network, consistent with the other local deployments in this
workspace.

### PodDisruptionBudgets

Single-replica stateful services (`database`, `cache`, `storage`, `search`, and
`broker`) set `maxUnavailable: 0`. Application and connect Deployments set
`minAvailable: 1` with selectors matching their pod template labels.

### ServiceAccounts

Each workload uses its own `ServiceAccount` (`deploy/serviceaccounts.yaml`,
applied first) instead of the namespace's shared `default`, limiting blast
radius for any future RBAC grant. `connect` is shared by the `connect`
Deployment and `broker-backfill` Job.

## Deployment Flow

`scripts/deploy.sh` applies manifests in stages: static policy resources,
infra dependencies, database, application services, then the broker backfill.
Images are built straight into the k3s node's Docker daemon and never
pushed anywhere — this only works because colima's single-node k3s uses
that same daemon as its container runtime (cri-dockerd); every workload
sets `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent` so kubelet uses the local image
instead of trying to pull one.
Custom images are tagged with a stable 12-character SHA-256 checksum of each
component's build inputs, so an apigateway-only change does not create new tags
for frontend, database, or the other services. Override
`APIGATEWAY_IMAGE_TAG`, `AUTHSERVICE_IMAGE_TAG`, `DATABASE_IMAGE_TAG`,
`FLOWSERVICE_IMAGE_TAG`, `FRONTEND_IMAGE_TAG`, `IMAGESERVICE_IMAGE_TAG`,
`POSTSERVICE_IMAGE_TAG`, or `USERSERVICE_IMAGE_TAG` only when a fixed tag is
deliberate.

Application manifests are rendered with the resolved tags before `kubectl
apply`, so unchanged workloads are not reset to the untagged images in source
manifests. Workloads that consume `cogito-db-secret` receive a
`checksum/cogito-db-secret` pod-template annotation; `connect` also receives a
`checksum/broker-pipelines` annotation. Secret or pipeline changes therefore
roll out the affected workload without restarting unrelated services.

The `broker-backfill` Job is created only when it has not completed before.
Use `FORCE_BACKFILL=1 scripts/deploy.sh` to deliberately delete and rerun it,
for example after resetting the search index.

The four Rust services (`authservice`, `userservice`, `imageservice`,
`flowservice`) build on `rust:1.95-trixie` with `cargo-chef` and run on
`debian:trixie-slim`, not Alpine/musl/`scratch` like the Go services.
Alpine's musl toolchain compiles noticeably slower for this dependency set
(sqlx, tonic, and `flowservice`'s cmake-built `rdkafka` in particular), and
`scratch` requires fully static binaries, which glibc doesn't produce by
default. `cargo-chef` plus `--mount=type=cache` on the registry and `target`
directories keep dependency rebuilds fast and shared across all four
Dockerfiles regardless of Docker layer cache invalidation.

All base images are pinned to a specific version rather than a floating
variant tag: `golang:1.26.5-alpine` (apigateway, postservice), `node:24-alpine`
(frontend, current Node LTS), `rust:1.95-trixie`/`debian:trixie-slim` (the
four Rust services, current Debian stable), `postgres:18.4-alpine` (database).

## Init Containers

| Deployment | Init image      | Action                                            |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| apigateway | cogito/database | Runs all pending migrations before gateway starts |

## Networking

No Ingress controller runs in this local cluster; `scripts/deploy.sh` exposes
`frontend` via `kubectl port-forward` instead.

All inter-service communication uses ClusterIP via Kubernetes DNS
(`service-name:port`). imageservice exposes two ClusterIP ports: 5050 (gRPC) and
8081 (HTTP). NetworkPolicies apply default-deny egress in the `cogito`
namespace, allow DNS to kube-system, and allow explicit in-namespace service
ports.

Long-lived application clients bound stale dependency state explicitly:
PostgreSQL pools set a 30 minute maximum connection lifetime and a 5 minute idle
timeout; apigateway gRPC clients send HTTP/2 keepalives every 30 seconds with a
10 second timeout and bounded reconnect backoff; the apigateway image HTTP proxy
uses a dedicated transport with bounded per-host connections, idle connection
expiry, and response-header timeouts. Flowservice logs per-consumer progress
every 60 seconds (`consumer`, `partition`, `offset`, and
`seconds_since_commit`) so stalled notification or feed pipelines are visible
without adding another consumer group or changing the protobuf contract.
Flowservice also exposes `GET /metrics` on port 8080 with canonical
`app_pipeline_*` Prometheus text metrics using labels
`app="cogito"`, `service="flowservice"`, and pipeline names `notifications` and
`feed`.

## Secrets

All secrets live in a single Kubernetes Secret named `cogito-db-secret`:

| Key                        | Consumers                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| database-password          | database (POSTGRES_PASSWORD)                                                    |
| cogito-app-password        | database init script                                                            |
| database-url               | authservice, userservice, postservice, imageservice, flowservice (DATABASE_URL); includes `sslmode=disable` |
| internal-grpc-token        | All gRPC services + apigateway (INTERNAL_GRPC_TOKEN)                            |
| session-hmac-secret        | apigateway + authservice (SESSION_HMAC_SECRET)                                  |
| search-master-key          | search (MEILI_MASTER_KEY) + flowservice (MEILI_MASTER_KEY)                      |
| s3-access-key              | storage (config) + imageservice (S3_ACCESS_KEY)                               |
| s3-secret-key              | storage (config) + imageservice (S3_SECRET_KEY)                               |
| s3-provisioning-access-key | storage (config) + imageservice startup (S3_PROVISIONING_ACCESS_KEY)          |
| s3-provisioning-secret-key | storage (config) + imageservice startup (S3_PROVISIONING_SECRET_KEY)          |

Generated by `scripts/deploy.sh` using `openssl rand -hex 32` (or equivalent),
including the PostgreSQL app password. Existing values are not regenerated on
re-runs; missing keys are added in place. SeaweedFS renders its S3 identity
config from these
Secret keys into an in-memory pod volume at startup; the rendered config is not
stored in a ConfigMap. The normal S3 identity is limited to image object reads,
writes, listing, and tagging. The separate provisioning identity is used by
imageservice only during startup to create or verify the image bucket.

PostgreSQL must run with `wal_level=logical` so Redpanda Connect `pg_cdc` can
relay `outbox` inserts. Migration `000008` creates the required `outbox_relay`
publication (`CREATE PUBLICATION outbox_relay FOR TABLE outbox`); the `connect`
deployment will crash-loop until this publication exists.

All services: `DATABASE_URL` (from secret), `INTERNAL_GRPC_TOKEN` (from secret).

## Search Migration Notes

`deploy/search.yaml` sets `MEILI_DB_PATH` to `/data/search`; earlier clusters
used `/data/meilisearch`. On an existing cluster with a populated search PVC,
Meilisearch will start with an empty index at `/data/search` while the old data
remains under `/data/meilisearch`. After the `search` StatefulSet rolls out,
trigger a full reindex by running the `broker-backfill` Job.

## Migration Strategy

- Migrations in `apps/database/migrations/` as paired `NNNNNN_name.up.sql` /
  `.down.sql`.
- Applied by `apigateway` init container at startup using `migrate/migrate`.
- Applied history is append-only. Deployed schemas are corrected with new
  migrations, never by editing existing ones.
- Mixed-version compatibility required when a schema change affects multiple
  independently deployed services.
- Current: 8 migration pairs (000001 through 000008).

## Deployment Script

`scripts/deploy.sh` is idempotent. Sequence:

1. Verify `kubectl`, `docker`, `make`, and `openssl` are available.
2. Use the current Kubernetes context and create namespace `cogito` (skip if
   exists; override with `NS`).
3. Generate or repair `cogito-db-secret`.
4. Compute per-component image tags and build/push each image via `make
   <service> IMAGE_PREFIX="$REGISTRY" GIT_SHA="$tag"`.
5. Apply static manifests, infra StatefulSets, and broker resources except the
   backfill Job; wait for infra rollouts.
6. Apply the database StatefulSet and wait for it.
7. Render application manifests with resolved image tags, apply them, stamp
   secret checksum annotations, and wait for application rollouts.
8. Stamp connect secret/configmap checksum annotations and wait for connect.
9. Run `broker-backfill` once, or rerun with `FORCE_BACKFILL=1`.
10. Start port-forward supervisor: `frontend:8080` → `localhost:8080`.

## Dependency Restart Drill

Run `scripts/failure-drill.sh` after changing dependency clients, probes, or
consumer loops. The script restarts PostgreSQL, cache, broker, search, and
storage workloads, then waits for application, connect, and frontend deployments
to remain rolled out. Override the namespace and wait budget with
`NAMESPACE=...` and `TIMEOUT=...`.

Long-lived database, HTTP, and gRPC clients must keep explicit connection
lifetimes, idle limits, keepalive, and reconnect backoff. Flow consumers log
partition and offset progress periodically so a restarted broker or stalled
pipeline has an operator-visible signal instead of relying only on process
liveness.
